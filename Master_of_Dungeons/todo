MASTER OF DUNGEONS TODO LIST (82% Progress)
When this list is complete/empty and extensive testing and bugfixing has been done, bump to version 1.0
Each top level point removed yields 2% completion.

 (1) Inventory Containers
     * There are several allowed shop actions.
       * Host-only:
         * Alter stock of each item in a shop (number input).
         * Include stock templates for various levels of advancement so shop can be populated quickly.
       * Any unit on hex:
         * Buy items from shops.
         * Sell items to shop (math.floor(0.8 * cost)).

     * There are several allowed container actions.
       * Host-only:
         * Alter stock of each item in a container (number input).
       * Any unit on hex:
         * Remove item from container.
         * Add item to container (number input).

  (1b) Inventory Containers II
       * Host shop configurations.
         * Make a shop not able to buy items.
         * Change shop buy percentage multiplier
         * Change shop price multiplier
         * Make certain items unsellable.

       * When a container has its last item removed:
         * A pack is removed from the map automatically.
         * A chest is replaced with an open chest image until an item is put in it again.

       * When a unit with inventory dies, its inventory is automatically dropped into a newly created leather pack container.
         * If it dies on a hex with an existing container that is not a pack, a pack is on the hex (hidden) and can be accessed.
         * If it dies on a hex with an existing pack, the items are added to the pack's items.

 (2) Inventory
     (a) Interaction
         * Give to adjacent unit.
           * Inventory
           * Gold (if leader)
           * Gold coins (item) if not leader (anyone should be able to hold them, but only leader should be able to cash them)

     (b) Haste potion.
         * Extra melee strike, +2 total moves.
         * Small = 2 turns, Medium = 4 turns.
         * Multiple potions stack the turn duration, not the effect strength.

     (c) Ale.
         * "Confidence" ability: +5 max HP for 3 turns.
         * 25% chance of also becoming drunk (berserk melee) for that duration
         * More ale stacks the turn duration, not the effect strength, but the 25% chance of berserk melee is on applying each ale.
         * Perhaps un-marskman all marksman attacks for that duration too.

     (d) Implement effects for the scrolls.
         * Gain wisdom (experience)
         * Radius healing (everything on one side within some radius for some amount of HP)
         * Summon <type> (enables you to summon for one turn and then disables summoning)
         * Resurrection (when resurrection table exists)
         * Flight (allows a temporary flying movetype)
         * Teleportation (used twice, the first remembers a spot and then second teleports you back there)
         * Faerie fire (one turn)
         * Fireball (one turn)

     (e) Implement equipment.
         * Using the item equips it into an equipment spot.
         * Unequipping it is possible from its own menu.
         * When the unit dies, all equipment is dropped with inventory.
         * When equipping an item to a spot that already has something, the old equipment is automatically unequipped.
         * Certain units (e.g. wolves) can't equip things.


 (3) Upgrades
     * All units get an upgrade point on promotion.
     * Units store a counter of every upgrade bought.
     * Include the following possible advancements:
       * + 1 movement (cost: 3, cap: 2)
       * + 3 hitpoints (cost: 1)
       * + 1 to melee attacks' damage (cost: 2, increases by 1 each time)
       * + 1 to range attacks' damage (cost: 2, increases by 1 each time)
         * Restrict to units with non-temporary range attack.
       * - 20% XP to next promotion (cost: 2, cap: 2)


 (4) Miscellaneous
     * Make the host modification/management of units more powerful.
       * Have the host modify inventory quantity rather than just add to it.
       * Toggle the boss healthy/regenerate on/off.
         * Perhaps give bosses extra traits so this doesn't break.
       * Allow a unit to be saved into persistant variables for import.

     * Getting units to the game.
       * Allow the placement of any unit instantly via textbox like Transform.
         * Make sure they're loyal like summoned units.
       * Allow import of units saved in persistant variables.
       * Save units when they die to a resurrection table.
       * The host should be able to resurrect a unit.
       * Add a way to control the recalling of units, recall lists, and saving of items, dead units, etc., across scenarios in a campaign.
         * Prevent the traditional keep-and-gold recalling of units.
         * Make sure that NPCs/enemies can be recalled, not just player summons.

     * Implement additional objects on maps:.
       * teleporters
       * traps (damage and/or status modifier on touching a hex)
       * doors (instead of manually removing walls)
       * keys/locks for doors/chests/etc.

 (4b) Details
     * DungeonOpt
       * Write a method for handling text_input
         * Add a cancel option to text stuff (speaking, transforming unit, etc.).
       * Rewrite to handle the extra filters and other things that prevent all files from using DungeonOpt.
       * Add helper functions for more option/menu functions than just options_list_short()
       * Make the toggle <foo> in settings say what the current state is.

     * Existing issues.
       * Let people choose their own unit type in the intro screen if they're a peasant instead of relying on transform.
       * Have the host restrict what's possible (level, etc.)
       * If a unit is transferred to an Undead and then to something else they stay Undead in their traits.
       * Fix changing summoner role when cancelling.
       * What does Change Unit > Save do?
       * Block right click menu items on map border because they cause unpredictable bugs.
       * Fix the changing objectives so that it works again.
         * Have the new interface change subsections (victory, loss, etc.) instead of the whole thing so that formatting can be preserved.

     * Terrains.
       * Make sure new 1.12 terrains are in the game.
       * Add repeat last overlay.
       * Fix remove overlay.
       * Fix some bridges and other broken overlays.
       * Test all terrains/overlays over again.

       * Move a lot of terrains into overlays only (villages, forests, etc.)

    * Summoners and units.
       * Make sure all units in the game are a summoner or a summoned unit.
       * Add a toggleable default summoner gender for when two genders are possible for summoners so it doesn't always default to male.
       * Add preset super summoners for the late game when people have strong units, and to make high-level summons accessible.
       * Reduce max HP on summoner by 1 per level of active summoned unit?

     * Rewrite the older parts of the MoD code.
       * Make sure that it's in three layers: pseudo-libraries, core MoD action functions, and data/config files.
       * Make sure that all reasonable things that can be modified in Lua and/or WML are available to host menus.
         * Allow modifying attacks and traits if possible.

(5) Future
    * Have game options allow other methods of summoning than just HP deduction.
    * Have dynamic_difficulty() working and optionally use it to scale the HP and damage of units spawned by player 1.

MASTER OF DUNGEONS TODO LIST (82% Progress)
When this list is complete/empty and extensive testing and bugfixing has been done, bump to version 1.0
Each point removed yields 2% completion.

 (1) Inventory
     (a) Shops
         (i)   place shops (host only)
         (ii)  stock items in shops (host only)
         (iii) buy items from shops (at cost)
         (iv)  sell to (at 4/5 nearest integer of cost)

     (b) Give inventory from unit to adjacent unit.
         (i) also give gold from the unit's side to the adjacent unit's side

     (c) Allow the host to attach gold or items to chests (picked up when opened).
         (i)  Treat chests like units for adding inventory, but with no use inventory.
         (ii) Make it a part of a place object menu item for hosts.

     (d) Drop a unit's inventory into a leather-pack.png on death; functions like chest.

     (e) Implement potion effects.
         (i) Green potions: Haste. Extra melee strike, +2 MP. Small = 2 turns, Medium = 4 turns. Multiple potions stack the turn duration, not the effect strength. 
         (ii) Ale: +5 max HP for 3 turns, 25% chance of also becoming drunk (berserk melee) for that duration; more ale = longer duration (and more effect?)

     (f) Implement effects for the scrolls.


 (2) On advancement, units earn an upgrade point.
     (*) Make default AMLA for all units not raise max hitpoints, but instead increment an upgrade point variable. (Regular advances should do this too.)
     (a) + 1 movement (three points, capped at 2)
     (b) + 3 hitpoints (one point)
     (c) + 1 to range or melee damage (starts at two points; increases by one each purchase)
     (d) - 20% XP to next promotion (two points, capped at 2)


 (3) Add/Remove Objects
     (a) Intramap teleporters.
     (b) Traps.
     (c) Keys/locks for doors/chests/etc.


 (4) Miscellaneous
     (*) Test to see where the "Cancel" options are broken.
     (*) Add cancel options to [text_input] stuff
     (*) The last menus/options that use WML tables and fire() should stop... Rewrite DungeonOpt for this.
     (*) Allow unit import/export through persistant variables if possible!
     (*) Write a DungeonOpt function for text_input
     (*) Make the miniboss healthy+regenerates toggleable on/off on all units.
     (*) [modify_side.cfg] Fix the ability to change objectives, using a new, more limited way.


 (4b) Terrains/Units
     (*) [modify_terrain] Repeat overlay, move overlays to second position, fix remove overlay, fix bridges, test all terrains/overlays again.
     (*) All units, terrains, and overlays available in-game should be usable in MoD.
     (*) Add a "default summoner gender" for when two genders are possible for summoners.
     (*) Add some preset super-summoners for the late game.

 (5) Finally...
     (a) Add a way to control the recalling of units and recall lists in a campaign.
     (b) Rewrite older parts of the code and make sure it's in three layers: objects, functions, and configurations.
     (c) Allow the host to be able to change village cap, gpv, and other variables with EoT compatability code.
     (d) Work on compatability code with other eras.

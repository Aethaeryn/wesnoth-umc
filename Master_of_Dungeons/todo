MASTER OF DUNGEONS TODO LIST (87% Progress)
When this list is complete/empty and extensive testing and bugfixing has been done, bump to version 1.0

  - Finish GUI2 rewrite.
  - Add back in the variable cost when summoning from a summoner.
  - Rewrite large parts of the code now that the new GUI simplifies things.
  - Placing a gold pile is now broken.
  - Add back in images for menu_inventory()

 (1) Inventory Containers (3%)
       * Templates:
         * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking shops.
         * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking chests.
         * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking units (MOBs, player heroes, etc.)
       * Let units sell items to shop (math.floor(0.8 * cost))
       * When a container has its last item removed:
         * A pack is removed from the map automatically if it is emptied by a player.
         * An empty chest switches to an open chest image.
         * A shop stays, but perhaps gives some indication that it's empty.
       * When players add to an empty chest, an open chest image switches to a closed chest image.
       * Players should be able to add to and take from containers more than one item at a time.
       * When a unit with inventory dies, its inventory is automatically dropped into a newly created leather pack container.
         * If it dies on a hex with an existing pack, the items are added to the pack's items.
         * If it dies on a hex with a gold pile, the gold pile is replaced by a pack and the gold is added to the pack.
           * This will require something other than gold coins, which only exist in increments of 10.
         * If it dies on a hex with a shop, the inventory is added to the shop! Be careful!
         * If it dies on a hex with a chest, the inventory is added to the chest, even if it is locked. Be careful!
         * If a unit dies to plague, the inventory stays on the zombie until dead, but zombies cannot manage inventory!
       * Players need to be able to remove items from packs (but not add to them).
       * The host needs more power with inventory (player and container):
         * Add item amount (implemented).
         * View inventory.
         * Change total quantity.
         * Remove item amount.
         * Remove all of a certain type.
         * The interface should be identical for containers, except with templates for containers.
         * In fact, units could have templates too once drops are implemented.

 (2) Interaction (2%)
       * Make interaction (e.g. with shops) a menu item instead of part of Unit Commands so it's more discoverable.
       * Add interaction with neighboring tiles for units and for shops. Chests/gold should require you to be on the hex.
         * Hostile units on the shop hex should block shop use, though.
       * When interaction is ambiguous (more than one unit who can interact), first pop up a window to let players choose which unit does the interaction.
       * Let units give things to adjacent friendly unit.
         * Inventory (all unequipped items)
         * Gold (if leader)
         * Gold coins (item) if not leader (anyone should be able to hold them, but only leader should be able to cash them)
         * Not all units can be interacted with (e.g. zombies).
       * This means those units (like zombies) can't use Unit Commands, either, but host can give them items and they can get items and equipment inherited if they were plagued.
         * This means host probably needs to be able to equip units, if for flavor reasons zombies need to be equipped.

 (3) Inventory (2%)
     (a) Haste potion.
         * Extra melee strike, +2 total moves.
         * Small = 2 turns, Medium = 4 turns.
         * Multiple potions stack the turn duration, not the effect strength.
     (b) Ale.
         * "Confidence" ability: +5 max HP for 3 turns.
         * 25% chance of also becoming drunk (berserk melee) for that duration
         * More ale stacks the turn duration, not the effect strength, but the 25% chance of berserk melee is on applying each ale.
         * Perhaps un-marskman all marksman attacks for that duration too.
     (c) Implement spells for the scrolls.
         * Gain wisdom (experience)
         * Radius healing (everything on one side within some radius for some amount of HP)
         * Summon <type> (enables you to summon for one turn and then disables summoning)
         * Flight (allows a temporary flying movetype)
         * Teleportation (used twice, the first remembers a spot and then second teleports you back there)
         * Faerie fire (new ranged attack for one turn)
         * Fireball (new ranged attack for one turn)

 (4) Details (3%)
     * Make upgrades warn you when you cannot buy them instead of failing silently.
     * Raise the cap on intelligence upgrades so there can be more than one?
     * Add strength and dexterity upgrades.
       * They probably need to be implemented differently, with [object]
     * Make the host modification/management of units more powerful.
       * Make sure to handle negative numbers properly.
       * Toggle the boss healthy/regenerate on/off.
         * Perhaps give bosses extra traits so this doesn't break.
       * Make sure that everything that can be done in Lua to a unit is doable somehow.
       * Allow modifying attacks and traits if possible.
     * Add a way to control the recalling of units and recall lists.
       * Prevent the traditional keep-and-gold recalling of units.
       * Make sure that NPCs/enemies can be recalled, not just player summons.
     * Implement additional objects on maps:
       * teleporters (very high priority for large maps!!!)
       * traps (damage and/or status modifier on touching a hex)
       * doors (instead of manually removing walls)
       * keys/locks for doors/chests/etc.
       * triggers (perhaps runes?) for various things (including doors)
     * DungeonOpt
       * Write a method for handling text_input
         * Add a cancel option to text stuff (speaking, transforming unit, etc.).
       * Rewrite to handle the extra filters and other things that prevent all files from using DungeonOpt.
       * Add helper functions for more option/menu functions than just options_list_short()
       * Make the toggle <foo> in settings say what the current state is.
       * Rewrite to be a function instead of an object?
    * Summoners.
       * Add a toggleable default gender to use when two genders are possible so it doesn't always default to male.
         * Allow one option, the default, to be Random Gender. Make sure to use a random that's MP safe.
         * Make sure one-gender units stay the gender they're supposed to be, just in case Transform is used.
     * Terrains.
       * Make sure new 1.10 and 1.12 terrains are in the game. All terrains, etc., in the game should be usable.
       * Clean up overlay code.
         * Possibly rewrite how overlays are added.
         * Add repeat last overlay.
         * Fix remove overlay.
         * Fix some bridges and other broken overlays.
       * Move a lot of terrains into overlays only (villages, forests, etc.)
     * Check how inventory's effects interact if promoted while the effect is still on.
     * Check if upgrades are preserved on promotions. (They are on AMLAs.)
     * Don't have XP to next AMLA increase each AMLA?
     * Let Sylphs and/or Shydes disguise themselves as regular Elvish Ladies.
       * They would stay as summoners but lose the icon, being the only stealth summoners in the game.

 (5) Issues (3%)
       * VERY MAJOR BUG: Block right click menu items on map border because they cause unpredictable bugs.
       * BUG: If a unit is transformed to Undead and then to something else they stay Undead in their traits.
       * BUG: Shops can be placed on impassable and unwalkable territory. This shouldn't happen.
       * BUG: Fix icon size for Summon <foo> and Summon Summoner.
       * BUG: Transforming a unit to a female-only unit doesn't actually change its gender, so if it's transformed again it's still male.
       * BUG: Changing the gender of a unit doesn't change its portrait to the other variant.
         * In fact, it locks the unit into the old portrait even if it promotes.
       * BUG: Transforming a leader unit will automatically give it quick on the next map if becomes a dwarf, wose, etc. (4 MP?)
       * BUG: Display dashes instead of underscores in the menu for Qatif_al_nar/Qatif-al-nar
       * FEATURE: Replace non-debug uses of wesnoth.message() with a player-specific message box instead.
       * FEATURE: When something spawns on a village they don't own they should lose all movement and take the village.
       * FEATURE: When people are peasants on one of the two Intro maps (i.e. they died or it's a new campaign), let them pick a new unit.
         * data/units.lua probably can be reused if summoners are added to the regular unit list, but then filtered out in the actual Summon Foo
         * This menu can also be used to spawn every single unit as regular non-summoning/non-summoned enemies/NPC for flavor
           * Just make sure they're loyal.
           * Or find a way to get rid of unit upkeep altogether instead of making everything loyal.
         * This menu could also then replace the textbox in Transform.
       * FEATURE: Have the host restrict what units are possible for peasants to use (level, etc.)
       * FEATURE: Fix the changing objectives so that it works again.
         * Have the new interface change subsections (victory, loss, etc.) so that formatting can be preserved.
       * FEATURE: Change the XP level from 100% or just modify AMLA XP to be lower?

 (6) Future
    * Add preset super summoners for the late game when people have strong units, and to make high-level summons accessible.
      * Boost Ancient Lich HP to 101 so they can summon the Skeletal Dragon without first changing their HP.
      * Make sure there's a summoner who can summon the Yeti (Earth, 80 HP).
      * Make sure there's a summoner who can summon the Fire Drgaon (Fire, 100 HP).
    * Reduce max HP on summoner by 1 per level of active summoned unit?
    * Do something with boats?
    * Is there a way to alter promotions? Lich -> Ancient Lich; Wolf -> Great Wolf -> Dire Wolf; Armageddon Drake; etc.
    * Remove shroud for intermission ("Intro") mini-maps and for the battle arena?
    * Implement spells for magical units, like scrolls but learnable for the duration of the game instead of temporary.
    * Implement equipment (an extension of the inventory concept).
      * Using the item equips it into an equipment spot.
      * Unequipping it is possible from its own menu.
      * When the unit dies, all equipment is dropped like the regular inventory.
        * Unless that unit is turned into a zombie with plague, then it is kept until the zombie is killed.
      * When equipping an item to a spot that already has something, the old equipment is automatically unequipped.
      * Certain units (e.g. wolves) can't equip things.
      * Certain units (e.g. walking corpses) can have equipment, but can't manage it when alive.
    * Have game options allow other methods of summoning than just HP deduction.
    * Fix dynamic_difficulty() and optionally use it to scale the HP and damage of units spawned by player 1.
    * Resurrection.
      * When units die they are saved in a resurrection table.
      * The host can resurrect a unit. (rematches of old bosses?)
      * A resurrection spell on a scroll should be able to resurrect a unit too.
    * Make sure units can optionally gain healthy/regenerates if turned into a summoner.
    * Allow import of units saved in persistant variables. (Across scenarios? Is this Change Unit > Save?)
    * Allow the saving of items (in chests/shops too?), etc., across scenarios in a campaign.
    * Story-important, unsellable items.
    * More Shop Stuff:
      * Shop options toggleable by host:
        * Make a shop not able to buy items.
        * Change shop price multiplier for selling to shop
        * Change shop price multiplier for buying to shop (for expensive shops)
      * Add more shop graphics for different flavor.
      * Maybe find a way to keep the shops labelled as long as they are shops like many RPGs do?
    * Add a difficulty mode that restricts what the host can do so more people can play as a fair host?
    * Generalize the API so things like terrain changes can be restricted, have costs, be done by units, etc.?
    * Require download (as [modification]?), but make the Lua imported in a cleaner way and define some custom WML tags.
      * Make sure that only things that need to be run every side_turn are run then.

AETHAERYN'S MOD TODO LIST (90% Progress)
When this list is complete/empty, bump to version 0.9

  (1%)
  - terrain_editor.lua
    - rewrite menus for terrains and overlays to use gui2
    - delete DungeonOpt.lua
  - Slider instead of text input:
    - Gold quantity.
    - Inventory quantity.

 (1) Inventory Containers (2%)
     * Investigate drop (pack container)
     * Players should be able to:
       * Sell items to shop (math.floor(0.8 * cost))
       * Add and remove (and buy and sell) from containers more than one item at a time.
       * Remove only part of the gold from a gold pile. (slider that defaults to max)
       * Remove items from packs but not add to them.
     * Templates:
       * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking shops.
       * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking chests.
       * Have tiered templates for quick-stocking units (MOBs, player heroes, etc.)
       * Add menu to show templates when placing shops/chests/packs with the default being the "Empty" template.
     * When a container has its last item removed:
       * A pack is removed from the map automatically.
       * An empty chest switches to an open chest image.
       * A shop stays, but if shop labels can work, "Shop" changes to "Shop (Empty)".
     * When players add to an empty chest, an open chest image switches to a closed chest image.
     * When a unit with inventory dies, its inventory is automatically dropped into a newly created leather pack container.
       * If it dies on a hex with an existing pack, the items are added to the pack's items.
       * If it dies on a hex with a gold pile, the gold pile is replaced by a pack and the gold is added to the pack.
         * This will require something other than gold coins, which only exist in increments of 10.
         * Maybe allow both gold piles and packs on the same hex, distinguishing with Interact.
       * If it dies on a hex with a shop, the inventory is added to the shop! Be careful!
       * If it dies on a hex with a chest, the inventory is added to the chest, even if it is locked. Be careful!
       * If a unit dies to plague, the inventory stays on the zombie until dead, but zombies cannot manage inventory!
     * The host should be able to (for units and containers):
       * Add item amount.
       * View inventory.
       * Change total quantity.
       * Remove item amount.
       * Remove all of a certain type.
       * Add all items in template to unit inventory or container inventory.
       * Modify gold amount and item pack inventory.

 (2) Interaction (2%)
       * Make interaction (e.g. with shops) a menu item instead of part of Unit Commands so it's more discoverable.
       * Add interaction with neighboring tiles for units and for shops. Chests/gold should require you to be on the hex.
         * Hostile units on the shop hex should block shop use, though.
       * When interaction is ambiguous (more than one unit who can interact), first pop up a window to let players choose which unit does the interaction.
       * Let units give things to adjacent friendly unit.
         * Inventory (all unequipped items)
         * Gold (if leader)
         * Gold coins (item) if not leader (anyone should be able to hold them, but only leader should be able to cash them)
         * Not all units can be interacted with (e.g. zombies).
       * This means those units (like zombies) can't use Unit Commands, either, but host can give them items and they can get items and equipment inherited if they were plagued.
         * This means host probably needs to be able to equip units, if for flavor reasons zombies need to be equipped.
       * Allow certain units to be bribed (and mark with certain icon?) if the host toggles them.
         * For 1.5x cost in gold, they will change to player's team and then lose the ability to be bribed.
         * In addition to a unit-by-unit setting, there will be an option that will allow some lower-level units to spawn as bribable:
           * 100% chance for spawned non-summoner level 0s
           * 15% chance for spawned non-summoner level 1s
           * 10% chance for spawned non-summoner level 2s
           * Undead, Elemental, animals, etc., cannot be bribed unless manually set that way.

 (3) Inventory (1%)
     (a) Haste potion.
         * Extra melee strike, +2 total moves.
         * Small = 2 turns, Medium = 4 turns.
         * Multiple potions stack the turn duration, not the effect strength.
     (b) Ale.
         * "Confidence" ability: +5 max HP for 3 turns.
         * 25% chance of also becoming drunk (berserk melee) for that duration
         * More ale stacks the turn duration, not the effect strength, but the 25% chance of berserk melee is on applying each ale.
         * Perhaps un-marskman all marksman attacks for that duration too.

 (4) Details (2%)
     * Extend the GUI2 wrapper so that it can handle more  than one return value.
       * Some windows could do more than one action with sliders, checkboxes, etc., instead of with text input.
         * especially changing side variables
           * showing all the stats at once instead of only on select would be useful here too
         * when setting objectives (three or more different text inputs at once)
         * also changing unit stats
       * Make the toggles have their own submenu in settings.
         * make them use checkboxes
         * make them say what the current state is based on check/uncheck
     * Pick character dialog.
       * If peasant on first turn of an intro map (e.g. new campaign or unit died), let sides 2-5 pick a new unit.
         * Perhaps let the host fire this at other times to let players create a new character, e.g. when handing side 7 or 8 to observers or recycling a dead side 2-5 to observers.
         * data/units.lua probably can be reused if summoners are added to the regular unit list, but then filtered out in the actual Summon Foo
         * Have the host restrict what units are possible for peasants to use (level, type, etc.) or let a vote be held first on the level.
       * This menu can also be used to spawn every single unit as regular non-summoning/non-summoned enemies/NPC for flavor
         * And also make sure that there's a way to mass-spawn a whole group of NPCs for quickly setting up towns/enemies.
         * And eventually they can be tied to map logic to spawn during variants of the RPG when the host is not omnipotent.
         * And of course this opens the door to quests, preset interactions/messages, etc.
         * Including perhaps fancy dialog-driven RPG-style branching texts where you choose responses.
       * This menu could also then replace the textbox in Transform.
     * Upgrades
       * Raise the cap on intelligence upgrades so there can be more than one?
       * Add strength and dexterity upgrades.
         * They probably need to be implemented differently, with [object]
       * Damage increase should probably actually be roughly constant, i.e. more damage increase for units with fewer strikes
         * e.g. +4 if 1 strike, +2 if 2 strikes, +1 otherwise
       * There needs to be a visible indicator over the unit that the unit can be upgraded.
     * Make the host modification/management of units more powerful.
       * Make sure to handle negative numbers properly.
         * Or use sliders and keep values within a reasonable range.
       * Toggle the boss regenerate on/off, e.g. optionally for when turned to/from summoner.
       * Make sure that everything that can be done in Lua to a unit is doable somehow.
       * Allow modifying attacks and traits if possible.
     * Add a way to control the recalling of units and recall lists.
       * Prevent the traditional keep-and-gold recalling of units.
       * Make sure that NPCs/enemies can be recalled, not just player summons.
     * Implement non-container objects on maps:
       * teleporters (very high priority for large maps!!!)
       * traps (damage and/or status modifier on touching a hex)
       * doors (instead of manually removing walls)
       * keys/locks for doors/chests/etc.
         * also doors/chests/etc. that can only open for certain sides or teams or units
       * triggers (perhaps runes?) for various things (including doors)
    * Summoners.
       * Add a toggleable default gender to use when two genders are possible so it doesn't always default to male.
         * Allow one option, the default, to be Random Gender. Make sure to use a random that's MP safe.
         * Make sure one-gender units stay the gender they're supposed to be, just in case Transform is used.
     * Terrains.
       * Make sure new 1.10 and 1.12 terrains are in the game. All terrains, etc., in the game should be usable.
       * Clean up overlay code.
         * Possibly rewrite how overlays are added.
         * Add repeat last overlay.
         * Fix remove overlay.
         * Fix some bridges and other broken overlays.
       * Move a lot of terrains into overlays only (villages, forests, etc.)
     * Check how inventory's effects interact if promoted while the effect is still on.
     * Let Sylphs and/or Shydes disguise themselves as regular Elvish Ladies.
       * They would stay as summoners but lose the icon, being the only stealth summoners in the game.

 (5) Issues (2%)
       * VERY MAJOR BUG: Block right click menu items on map border because they cause unpredictable bugs.
       * BUG: If a unit is transformed to Undead and then to something else they stay Undead in their traits.
       * BUG: Fix icon size for Summon <foo> and Summon Summoner.
       * BUG: Transforming a unit to a female-only unit doesn't actually change its gender, so if it's transformed again it's still male.
       * BUG: Changing the gender of a unit doesn't change its portrait to the other variant.
         - In fact, it locks the unit into the old portrait even if it promotes.
       * BUG: Transforming a leader unit will automatically give it quick on the next map if becomes a dwarf, wose, etc. (4 MP?)
       * BUG: If the host has summoners of different types surround a hex, there will be too many Summon <Foo> for that hex and other menu items will start to be cut off.
       * BUG: Objectives don't show up right in the set menu.
       * FEATURE: Max_experience of 1 and 2 will never increase on AMLA'd units. Perhaps set a minimum of 3 or even 10 to avoid many multi-promotions.
       * FEATURE: AMLAing probably shouldn't increase max experience.
       * FEATURE: Change objectives by subsections (victory, loss, etc.) in a new interface so that formatting can be preserved.
       * FEATURE: Change the XP level from 100% or just modify AMLA XP to be lower?
       * FEATURE: If possible add a back button in addition to close for the complicated menus.
       * FEATURE: Replace Ancient Lich picture for menus/submenus in Unit Commands and Interaction.
       * CODE: Does 1.12 have a better way of dealing with advancement than event_post_advance() and event_advance()?
       * CODE: Find a replacement for get_roles() and get_sides_with_all()
       * CODE: Most places probably can check for an empty list before calling menu() and show a better error there.
         - Alternatively, have every call feed in an error message for when the list is empty instead of saying "None"
       * CODE: There's a lot of boiler plate when every menu makes sure that its value is not false (i.e. not closed with the close button) before doing something. There might be a better way.
       * CODE: Fix spacing on GUI2 GUIs, especially the error message and the areas with more than one button.
       * CODE: remove all submenu_ functions in upgrades.lua and terrain_editor.lua
       * CODE: inventory.lua and upgrades.lua need to put the non-menu functions in tables
         - inventory.lua is a mess; better functions can be written
         - upgrades.lua is a mess in the opposite direction; behavior could be moved into functions

 (6) Future
    * Magic [temporary via scrolls]
      * Gain wisdom (experience)
      * Radius healing (everything on one side within some radius for some amount of HP)
      * Summon <type> (enables you to summon for one turn and then disables summoning)
      * Flight (allows a temporary flying movetype)
      * Teleportation (used twice, the first remembers a spot and then second teleports you back there)
      * Faerie fire (new ranged attack for one turn)
      * Fireball (new ranged attack for one turn)
      * Also implement spells, which are similar but permanent and only for magical units.
    * Implement equipment (an extension of the inventory concept).
      * Using the item equips it into an equipment spot.
      * Unequipping it is possible from its own menu.
      * When the unit dies, all equipment is dropped like the regular inventory.
        * Unless that unit is turned into a zombie with plague, then it is kept until the zombie is killed.
      * When equipping an item to a spot that already has something, the old equipment is automatically unequipped.
      * Certain units (e.g. wolves) can't equip things.
      * Certain units (e.g. walking corpses) can have equipment, but can't manage it when alive.
    * Story-important, unsellable items.
    * Add preset super summoners for the late game when people have strong units, and to make high-level summons accessible.
      * Boost Ancient Lich HP to 101 so they can summon the Skeletal Dragon without first changing their HP.
      * Make sure there's a summoner who can summon the Yeti (Earth, 80 HP).
      * Make sure there's a summoner who can summon the Fire Drgaon (Fire, 100 HP).
    * Reduce max HP on summoner by 1 per level of active summoned unit?
    * Do something with boats?
    * Is there a way to alter promotions?
      * Ancient Lich; ENABLE_ANCIENT_LICH
      * Great Wolf & Dire Wolf; ENABLE_WOLF_ADVANCEMENT
      * Armageddon Drake; ENABLE_ARMAGEDDON_DRAKE
      * Dwarvish Runesmith; ENABLE_DWARVISH_RUNESMITH
      * Dwarvish Arcanister; ENABLE_DWARVISH_ARCANISTER
      * Troll Shaman; ENABLE_TROLL_SHAMAN
      * Death Knight; ENABLE_DEATH_KNIGHT
      * in mainline, this is done in [campaign] extra_defines in SoF and LoW, only one each
    * Resurrection.
      * When units die they are saved in a resurrection table.
      * The host can resurrect a unit. (rematches of old bosses?)
      * A resurrection spell on a scroll should be able to resurrect a unit too.
    * Make sure everything (including items, secondary units, and possibly shop inventories) can transition between scenarios.
    * More Shop Stuff:
      * Shop options toggleable by host:
        * Make a shop not able to buy items.
        * Change shop price multiplier for selling to shop
        * Change shop price multiplier for buying to shop (for expensive shops)
      * Add more shop graphics for different flavor.
      * Maybe find a way to keep the shops labelled as long as they are shops like many RPGs do?
    * Add a difficulty mode that restricts what the host can do so more people can play as a fair host.
      * Including locking out the terrain editing and the stats editing, and limiting the Summon Summoners.
      * Also make terrain changes able to have costs, require being done by units or triggers, etc.
      * Similarly, traps, chests, etc., could be manually placed and/or moved by units if this happens.
      * If the NPCs/mob sides are restricted or AI, a lot of the options like unit levels to start at could be done by player vote.
    * Require download (as [modification]?), but make the Lua imported in a cleaner way and define some custom WML tags.
      * This will solve the problem of what to do for certain icons, e.g. for potion types, scrolls, and menu items.
      * The current closed scroll icon could be used for unidentified scrolls if it's going to be like roguelikes and require identifying.
      * This means more units can be added.
        * Common level 0 for horseman and cavalryman.
        * Common level 0 for mage and dark adept.
        * Common level 0 for fencer/thief (both skirmish) or fencer/sergeant (both nobility with swords)?
        * Is there still that era that adds a lot of level 0s? Is the quality good enough?
    * Let the AI be able handle things as NPCs/enemies, including summoning.
      * A very high probability to summon each turn if activated and HP > 50%
      * This gives the units for the AI-controled side to use in battle.
    * Make sure that the translatable strings are marked as such.
    * Allow saving/import of units/etc. saved in persistant variables. (Across campaigns!)
    * Make the time of day last longer (3 turns per phase?) so alignment matters more on the huge maps
      * Is there a way to make caves properly cave (either whole maps or parts of maps) without imbalancing in favor of chaotic?
    * Eventually make this the framework for RPGs in general, not just ones where the host controls sides 1 & 6.
      * Not even just RPGs. A lot of the general code can be used for completely different game types, e.g. recruiting via villages.
